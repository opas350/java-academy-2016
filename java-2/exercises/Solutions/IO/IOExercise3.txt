Exercise 3
By Javier Reyes

3.-Which one of the following will create an InputStreamReader correctly?

a) new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("data"));
b) new InputStreamReader(new FileReader("data"));
c) new InputStreamReader(new BufferedReader("data"));
d) new InputStreamReader("data");
e) new InputStreamReader(System.in);

Answer:

The option a) and e) are the correct ones.
According with the documentation:
An inputStreamReader is a bridge from byte stream to character streams.

InputStreamReader(InputStream in);

In this case option a) and e) declarations are legal and could be used in a program.
The other options can't be used because they are implemented wrong.
